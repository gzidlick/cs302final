Report: This week we worked on creating a simple extension that changes the background of a webpage. The intended purpose of this
was to create a simple program that would act as a "Hello World!" tutorial. This would provide us with base knowledge on creating
Chrome extensions so that we can build from it into our main project. Team dynamic is good so far and everybody seems to understand the
steps we need to take to complete our project.


Milestones:

	Create Github Repository (10 pts):
		Create a Github repository so that all team members have a place to display progress in project.
	
	Create Manifest file (10 pts):
		Chrome extensions start with a Manifest file, this file should contain information about the extension and
		the version of Chrome that it is intended for. 
	
	Create a User Interface (10 pts):
		A user interface allows a user to interact with the program. Design a popup user interface that allows the user
		to click a button to perform an action.
	
	Make the button useful (10 pts):
		Using the button created in the last task, make it perform some type of action during an on-click event. My button will
		be changing the background color of chrome webpages.
