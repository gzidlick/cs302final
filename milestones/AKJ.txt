Build the Repo and begin research:
----------------------------------------
+ Status: Done
- Date: Fri Mar 8
   = Build a repository to store all the code for the
   project in. Make a folder and branch for each member of
   the group. Discuss how all the members should interact
   with and push to the master branch.

Complete Tutorial for Chrome extension:
----------------------------------------
+ Status: Done
- Date: Fri Mar 13 
   = The tutorial provided by google is to be completed and
   understood to a degree that will allow for the creation
   of the password managing extension we plan to create.

Extend the tutorial code:
----------------------------------------
+ Status: To be started
- Date: Fri Mar 13 
   = Create a chrome extension that can recognize the 
   password and username fields of a web page and prompt
   to fill them. The extension will interact with just a 
   plain text file.


Determine the encryption method:
----------------------------------------
+ Status: To be started
- Date: Fri Mar 13 
   = An encryption method with sufficient security.
   It, optimally, should be fast and reliable. How the
   data is to be stored such that it is easy, fast and
   secure to access is also to be determined.

Implement the encryption method:
----------------------------------------
+ Status: To be started
- Date: Fri Mar 13 
   = Implement that which was determined in the previous
   step. It may be easier here to implement the decrypter
   and indexer in the command line first and then stitch
   the result to the extension once done.
