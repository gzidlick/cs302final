**This is not intended for actual use in a setting where security is the priority.**
**This was made as  project in order to learn the tools needed to build a good web extension and learn some basic crytopgraphy.**
**Please do not attempt to use this as a means of managing password that protect important things.**
**We aren't responsible for lost data ❤️.**

Overview
-----
The project that lies in this repository is a general purpose password manager for the Google Chrome browser.
Username password pairs are stored and keyed with the URL they are used at.
This is all accessible with the given master password.
The key is actually stored as the hash of the given URL and the master password of the user.
This allows for the data structure to be harder to brute force, and it implicitly allows for multiple users!
The username password objects are stringified to a JSON string; this string is then encrypted with the hash of the master password as its key.
The encryption algorithm used is RC4.
It is a symmetric key based stream encryption algorithm.
The algorithm is quite old and has many known vulnerabilities, but it was in our wheelhouse to implement.
We believed that implementing our own algorithm would be very fun and worth while!
The Chrome extension stores the password in the Google sync storage so that all Google accounts that have the extension installed in the browser will have access to the data.

Install
-----
This is not an officially released Chrome extension so to install the project a few steps are required.
So, begin by cloning this repo into a known location.
Then go to the following link in the Chrome browser [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) .
Once there, enable developer mode the
